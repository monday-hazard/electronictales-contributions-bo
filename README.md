# electronictales-contributions-bo

## How to install the project

1. Clone the project on your local device :

`git clone https://github.com/monday-hazard/electronictales-contributions-bo.git`

You may need to install SSH keys locally, see GitHub or Gitlab docs for this.

2. Install dependencies

`npm i`

3. Connect to your database

Create `default.json` with your database logins (secret key etc)

4. Test the connection

In a terminal in the current project, run :

`npm run server`

You're good if it says that the mangoose got the couleuvre. Otherwise, check if your Internect connection uses a proxy, or if you made an error in your `default.json`
